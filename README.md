## Description

Through this project, I would like to conduct thorough analysis on sales data of 12 months by answering questions with insightful information from the raw data.

### Dependencies

* Anaconda Navigator - Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7 or above

### Installing

* Download & Install Anaconda Navigator then open Jupyter Notebook from there. (https://docs.anaconda.com/)
* Install Pandas from terminal in Jupyter Notebook
```
conda install pandas
```
*  Install matplotlib from terminal in Jupyter Notebook
```
conda install matplotlib
```
*  Install numpy from terminal in Jupyter Notebook
```
conda install numpy
```

### Executing program

1. Merge all 12 months data into one Master Data (all_data.csv)

2. Cleaning Data
- Drop NaN values rows from DataFrame
- Removing rows with invalid records
- Change the type of columns for analytics purpose (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

3. Solve Questions
- What were the highest & lowest months for sales? How much were earned those months?
- What city had the highest & lowest number of sales?
- What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product in order to increase sales for the lowest sales city above?
